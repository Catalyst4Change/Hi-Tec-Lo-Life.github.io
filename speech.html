    <h3>Joy is Resistance</h3>
<p>
  
* Thank you all for being here, especially those who showed up early to help set up.

* The Camp
    * This camp was born out of my love for the Burning Man community and Cyberpunk Bullshit. I've channeled my fears, my anxiety, and my excitement into the art you see around you.
    * This is my first time bringing an official theme camp to Apogaea and I am beyond excited to bring this gritty mess to my favorite party in the mountains.
* 
* The Community
    * The only thing I love more than art and parties is people. Specifically, you people. I have basically hand-picked this community because the darkness in me recognizes the darkness in you.
    * Queers. Neurodivergents. Weirdos. Outcasts.
    * Some of the kindest, smartest, weirdest, and most fun people I have ever met are in this tent and I am SO goddamn excited to have y'all here.
        * So many people have been willing to follow me (even into a literal ditch in the dark) and work with me to help me bring this idea to life. I am truly humbled.
        * But this isn't about me. I'm only here to connect people and to lift up the voices of those who might be too timid to speak up on their own.
        * Speaking of, Thank you Zyren for sharing your knowledge and resources.
        * Thank you Ember - who I am so unreasonably in love with - who has supported, encouraged, and empowered me every step of the way.
        * And thank you Jess, who has inspired and tolerated my bullshit for so long.
    * Acknowledge and introduce the crew.

* The Idea
    * Make no mistake my friends, we live in the future; and the future ain't what it used to be. Fascist government, 24-hour surveillance, militarized police, genocidal corporations, those creepy-ass robot dogs... We are in a cyberpunk dystopia. It is weird. It is fun.  And it is terrifying.
    * The powers that be in this country are too busy cowering under desks or sucking Trump's dick to actually do anything about the problems that we face on the daily
        * Rising prices, natural disasters, random acts of violence
        * The threat of being imprisoned or deported cause some asshole doesn't like your tattoos, or your gender, or your skin color.
    * We face ecological devastation, economic disruption, and existential dread. Our way of life, our safety, our very identities are at risk of being taken from us. It's fuckin scary out there yall.
    * There will come a day when that dystopia catches up to us. When that happens, we are the only ones we can rely on to save us. In this tent, in our communities, and out in the world - if we stand together, we stand strong.
    * A simple way to do that is through mutual aid. It's easier than it sounds; we don't need a registry, a dispatcher, a 501-C3. We only need friends helping friends; neighbors helping neighbors, people helping people.

* How to Practice Mutual Aid
    * Mutual aid doesn't mean giving with the intent of receiving something back. Like in the Burner community, you give for the joy of giving. If we all share that mentality, it will make its way back to you.
    * Start small: offer your couch to a friend who needs it. Share a meal when you have extra food. Trade skills, patch clothes, fix bikes, watch each other's pets and kids.
    * Build a web of support so strong that when the system fails, we are the net that catches us.
    * Every act of care is a step toward survival and a giant fuck-you to a world that wants us isolated and afraid.

* Everyone Has Something to Offer
    * Skill-sharing builds trust and deepens bonds. No skill is too small.
        * Ask audience for a skill they know well enough to share.
    * Not just "practical" skills like fixing cars or plumbing a sink. Emotional support, cooking a communal meal, lending a sympathetic ear—these are critical to our collective survival.
    * Mutual aid works both ways. Asking for help is just as important as offering it. 
    * Vulnerability is a strength, not a weakness. It takes immense courage to ask for help when you need it. Trusting your community enough to lean on them is how we grow stronger together.

* You Are Already Enough
    * Burnout is real. Existing is exhausting. Life asks a lot from us, and sometimes just surviving is all we can manage.
    * You don't have to "save the world" to be valuable to your community. Show up when you can, offer what you have, and rest when you need to.
    * We hold each other up—and sometimes that means just holding space.

* DIY and Cyberpunk Values
    * But we aren't just surviving—we are creating.
    * The theme of Cyberpunk isn’t just neon lights and robot fights; it’s about resisting broken systems by building new ones that serve us.
        * AI can help you learn almost anything. 
        * 3-D printers can create components and replace parts that you'd otherwise be forced to purchase. 
        * Encrypted apps allow us to communicate discreetly.
    * In a world designed to make us passive consumers, every act of building, repairing, and sharing is an act of rebellion. 

* Joy is Resistance
    * In these dark times, do not let them steal your joy. Joy is not a distraction from the fight—it is integral to it.
    * When we laugh, dance, create, and celebrate each other, we reclaim our humanity from a system that tries to strip it away.
    * Choosing joy is how we stay whole, how we remind ourselves - and each other - that our lives are worth fighting for.
    * Whether that's fighting the fascists in government, fighting the police in the streets, or fighting the darkness of our own thoughts - our joy is resistance, and it is inviolable.

* Closing Call to Action
    * After tonight, find one small thing you can do: check in on a friend, share a meal, teach a skill, ask for help.
    * We can build the world we want to live in with acts of care, trust, and solidarity.
    * Joy, creativity, and community are how we'll get through this - together.

* Chant Together
    * Joy is Resistance
    * Community is Strength
    * Solidarity is Survival
