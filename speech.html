  <h2>Joy is Resistance</h2>

  <p>Make no mistake my friends, we live in the future; and the future ain't what it used to be.</p>

  <p>Fascist government, 24-hour surveillance, militarized police, genocidal corporations, those creepy-ass robot dogs...</p>

  <p>We are in a cyberpunk dystopia.</p>
  <p>It is weird.</p>
  <p>It is fun.</p>
  <p>And it is <i>terrifying</i></p>.

  <p>The powers that be in this country are too busy cowering under their desks or suckin Trump's dick to actually do anything about the problems that we face on the daily.</p>

  <p>Rising prices.</p>
  <p>Natural disasters.</p>
  <p>Random acts of violence.</p>

  <p>The threat of being imprisoned or deported 'cause some asshole doesn't like your tattoos, or your gender, or your skin color.</p>

  <p>We face ecological devastation, economic disruption, and existential dread.</p>
  <p>Our way of life, our safety, our very identities are at risk of being taken from us.</p>
  <p>It's fuckin scary out there yall.</p>

  <p>There will come a day when that dystopia catches up to us.</p>
  <p>When that happens, - we are the only ones we can rely on to save us.</p>
  <p>In this tent, in our homes, in our communities, and out in the world - if we stand together, we stand strong.</p>

  <p>A simple way to do that is through mutual aid.</p>
  <p>It's easier than it sounds; we don't need a registry, a dispatcher, a 501-C3.</p>
  <p>We only need friends helping friends; neighbors helping neighbors, people helping people.</p>

  <p>Mutual aid doesn't mean giving with the intent of receiving something back.</p>
  <p>Like in the Burner community, you give for the joy of giving.</p>
  <p>If we all share that mentality, it will make its way back to you.</p>

  <p>Start small: Say 'hi' to someone who looks lonely. Share a meal when you have extra food. Offer your couch to a friend who needs it.</p>
  <p>Trade skills, patch clothes, fix bikes, watch each other's pets and kids.</p>

  <p>Build a web of support so strong that when the system fails, we are the net that catches us.</p>

  <p>Every act of care is a step toward survival and a giant <b>fuck-you</b> to a world that wants us isolated and afraid.</p>

  <p>Skill-sharing builds trust and deepens bonds.</p>
  <p>No skill is too small.</p>
  <p>And not just "practical" skills like fixing cars or plumbing a sink.</p>
  <p>Emotional support, cooking a communal meal, lending an empathetic ear; these are critical to our collective survival.</p>
  <p>Mutual aid works both ways.</p>
  <p>Asking for help is just as important as offering it.</p>
  <p>Vulnerability is a strength, not a weakness. It takes immense courage to ask for help when you need it.</p>
  <p>Trusting your community enough to lean on them is how we grow stronger together.</p>

  <p>Also... Burnout is real.</p>
  <p>Existing is <i>exhausting</i>.</p>
  <p>Life asks a lot from us, and sometimes just surviving is all we can manage.</p>
  <p>You don't have to "save the world" to be valuable to your community.</p>
  <p>Show up when you can, offer what you have, and rest when you need to.</p>
  <p>We hold each other up—and sometimes that means just holding space.</p>
  <p>But we aren't just surviving; we are <i>creating</i>.</p>

  <p>The theme of Cyberpunk isn’t just neon lights and robot fights; it’s about resisting broken systems by building new ones that work for <b>us</b>.</p>
  <p>AI can help you learn almost anything.</p>
  <p>3-D printers can create components and replace parts that you'd otherwise be forced to purchase.</p>
  <p>Encrypted apps allow us to communicate discreetly.</p>
  <br>
  <p>In a world designed to make us passive consumers, every act of building, repairing, and sharing is an act of rebellion.</p>

  <p>In these dark times, do not let them steal your joy.</p>
  <p>Joy is not a distraction from the fight—it is integral to it.</p>
  <p>When we laugh, dance, create, and celebrate each other, we reclaim our humanity from a system that tries to strip it away.</p>
  <p>Choosing joy is how we stay whole, how we remind ourselves - and each other - that our lives are worth fighting for.</p>
  <p>Whether that's fighting the fascists in government, fighting the police in the streets, or fighting the darkness of our own thoughts - our joy is resistance, and it is inviolable.</p>

  <p>After you leave tonight (or read this on the toilet), find one small thing you can do: check in on a friend, share a meal, teach a skill, ask for help.</p>
  <p>We can build the world we want to live in with acts of care, trust, and solidarity.</p>
  <p>Joy, creativity, and community are how we'll get through this - together.</p>

  <h3>say it together</h3>
  <p style="text-align:center;">Joy is Resistance</p>
  <p style="text-align:center;">Community is Strength</p>
  <p style="text-align:center;">Solidarity is Survival</p>
