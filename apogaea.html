  <h3>Responsibilities if joining Hi-Tec_Lo_Life</h3>
 <ol>
   <li>Assume a role in the camp</li>
     <p>As all collaboratve efforts, we will need to divide and conquer. Many hands make light work. Other ideoms. Help out, is the point.</p>

  <li>Pay camp dues</li>
     <p>It sucks, but to interface with a capitalistic world, HTLL needs funding. We are asking each member of the camp to pitch in 150$. This funding will go to group meals, camp water and hand-washing stations, art supplies, batteries, etc.If that cost is prohibitive, we can negotiate.</p>

   <li>Do a shift at the bar</li>
     <p>There will be public a bar set up at camp, active during certain hours. Every camp member will be asked to tend the bar for a few hours. This is an awesome way to meet new folks and interact with the community. Collect a cup from the customer, "check ID", and pour one of our pre-mixed drinks into their cup. Chat, hang, have a good time.</p>
   
   <li>Commit to the bit</li>
     <p>The theme of HTLL is "Cyberpunk Batchelor Pad". Aesthetically, this means we will have broken computer screens, LEDs, lasers, projectors, and all manner of futuristic bullshit mixed with low furniture and deeply casual anarchist vibes.</p>
      <p>While camp will never dictate what can or should be worn, it is encouraged to lean into the theme and wear apocolyptic/futuristic gear, especially if just hanging out at camp.</p>
      <p>Bonus points: choose or develop a persona, a character. Be it flamboyant edge runner or grizzled corpo, having a schtick will help sell the cyberpunk world we're creating.</p>

  <h3>Benefits if joining Hi-Tec_Lo_Life</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Camp water
        <p>One of the most pain in the ass things about Burning Man is lugging around huge quantities of water. As part of HTLL, we will anesthetize some of that pain and bring enough water for all. This includes our hand-washing station kept behind the bar. The Supreme Aquaficer is in charge of maintaining our water supply. </p>
      </li>
      <li>Camp meals
        <p>In previous experiences, we noticed that when everyone in a large camp is in charge of bringing their own food, you end up with a half-dozen coolers taking up space and so much food most of it ends up going bad. 
          <br>That's why this year we will be serving lunch every day during the event and will have snacks available throught. The <i>Priest of Provisions</i> will be in charge of making sure no one starves to death. That said, you are encouraged to bring your favorite snacks to share or hoarde for yourself.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Infrastructure
        <p>Being part of a larger camp, you will have access to our shade structures, furniture and other creature comforts including a generator to charge or run your equipment.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Community.
        <p>Finally, the best part of joining Hi-Tec_Lo-Life would be always having a safe and comfortable place to crash and hang with friends. Any size burn can be A LOT and sometimes you'll wanna get away from it all. If you're having a tough day or a scary trip, you can lean on your camp mates. We take care of us.</p>
